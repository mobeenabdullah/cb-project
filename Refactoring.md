# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

In my refactored code, I made several changes to improve readability and maintainability. First, I changed the name of the constant "TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY" to "DEFAULT_PARTITION_KEY", which better reflects its purpose. Second, I simplified the logic of checking if "event" is defined, and used an early exit strategy to avoid nested if statements. Third, I used more descriptive variable names, such as "partitionKey" instead of "candidate" and "eventData" instead of "data". Fourth, I moved the type checking and stringifying of the "partitionKey" variable to after it has been assigned a value, reducing unnecessary checks. Finally, I formatted the code to be more consistent and easy to read. These changes make the code more concise, clear, and easier to maintain.
